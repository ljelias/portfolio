                    <p>As a web developer I enjoy working with working with CSS, HTML, and Javascript to build highly functional web applications and make pages run smoothly. I focus on integrating the needs of both the user and the provider into pages that are well organized and effective for both sides. As a team member I have a knack for taking the various ideas of all team members and finding ways to consolidate and integrate the pieces into a well-organized whole. Ideally, I hope to integrate my background in education, linguistics, and/or music with my web development skills to create and contribute to collaborative projects.</p>
                    <p>My background in linguistics includes over 20 years of experience teaching college-level Spanish and English as a Second Language, and specializing in pronunciation and accent reduction.</p>
                    <p>My primay hobby is indoor and outdoor gardening. I completed an Urban Farming Apprenticeship in 2015 with Permacculture Research Institute, Cold Climate, and have been the coordinator of St. Stephen's Whittier Community Garden in south Minneapolis.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy animals as well. I currently have two cats and a gekco, but I have also had: a chinchilla, a bearded dragon, a salamander, finches, fish, guinea pigs, and a lost sparrow hatchling. I hope to have backyard chickens in the near future.</p>
                    <p>Other activities I enjoy are playing cello and hands-on renovating of my 100-year-old house.</p>
